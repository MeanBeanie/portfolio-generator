# portfolio generator

Generates a static html site based on a custom `.port` file that describes how text should be arranged.

The css for the site is given by the `css_file` in main.c, as its not meant to change often but rather be writen
once and then forgotten about whenever making updates to the site

for an example `.port` file, see the examples directory
